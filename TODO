reading subject via %s might return newlines, resolve this issue  

individual tracking / rules of branches (via patterns?)  

configuration file / args to control behaviour  

debugging mode that shows every commit and its effect on the version  

most/all types should be defined via newtype  

parseTag currently allows all sorts of non-user tags  

startVersion must be set via args / cfg  

print version of program in cli help / desc text  

current parsing of version might result in false positives (some long tag text and thenv1.3.2this)  

currently code base and args? mix e.g. Major and Breaking, avoid this
