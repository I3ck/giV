parseTag currently allows all sorts of non-user tags  

current parsing of version might result in false positives (some long tag text and thenv1.3.2this)  

extend tests  

parse all regexp for validity (only create Regexp if valid)  
precompile regular expressions (currently compiled on every use?)  

TryReadVersion should be Either  

there's two different TryReadVersion impls now  

split reference still needed?
