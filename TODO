reading subject via %s might return newlines, resolve this issue  

individual tracking / rules of branches (via patterns?)  

configuration file / args to control behaviour  

debugging mode that shows every commit and its effect on the version  

parseTag currently allows all sorts of non-user tags  

startVersion must be set via args / cfg (Could be assumed at 0.0.0 for now due to tagging option)  

print version of program in cli help / desc text  

current parsing of version might result in false positives (some long tag text and thenv1.3.2this)  

currently code base and args? mix e.g. Major and Breaking, avoid this  

consider git log <branch> --not master    for fetching history of certain branches  

tests  

usage of Text instead of String?  

config parse issues not really helpful
