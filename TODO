reading subject via %s might return newlines, resolve this issue  

individual tracking / rules of branches (via patterns?)  

parseTag currently allows all sorts of non-user tags  

print version of program in cli help / desc text  

current parsing of version might result in false positives (some long tag text and thenv1.3.2this)  

currently code base and args? mix e.g. Major and Breaking, avoid this  

consider git log <branch> --not master    for fetching history of certain branches  

tests  

usage of Text instead of String?  

config parse issues not really helpful  

way to define multiple feature branches with regex to match on name  

some of the code duplication caused by BranchMaster resolvable?
