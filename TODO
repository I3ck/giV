reading subject via %s might return newlines, resolve this issue  

parseTag currently allows all sorts of non-user tags  

print version of program in cli help / desc text  

current parsing of version might result in false positives (some long tag text and thenv1.3.2this)  

currently code base and args? mix e.g. Major and Breaking, avoid this  

tests  

usage of Text instead of String?  

config parse issues not really helpful  

parse all regexp for validity (only create Regexp if valid)  

there's a lot of logic within main now, move to helper functions / files  

display matched change rule in debug?  

show branch versioning as well in README (with name matching)
