parse whole commit instead of just subject

reading subject via %s might return newlines, resolve this issue  

parseTag currently allows all sorts of non-user tags  

print version of program in cli help / desc text  

current parsing of version might result in false positives (some long tag text and thenv1.3.2this)  

extend tests  

parse all regexp for validity (only create Regexp if valid)  
precompile regular expressions (currently compiled on every use?)  

TryReadVersion should be Either  

there's two different TryReadVersion impls now  

split reference still needed?
