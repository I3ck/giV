giV - Semantic versioning for Git repositories



State
-----

v0.1  
`giV` should work properly but is likely going to change in the future (see [TODO](TODO) or issue tracker for problems and missing features)



Build
-----

You'll need [Haskell Stack](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started)  

Clone this repo  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/I3ck/giV.git  
$ cd giV  
```

Either just build `giV`  
```
$ stack upgrade  
$ stack build  
```  

Or install it to your path
```
$ stack upgrade  
$ stack install  
```  



Run
---

`giV` expects `git` in your path  
If you built `giV` via `stack build`, you can run it via  
```
$ stack exec -- giV
```

If you installed it via `stack install`, just type  
```
$ giV
```



### Configuration

Before running, you should edit the [configuration file](giVcfg.yaml) to suit your needs.  
These settings are usually project specific and therefore located within this file.  
Settings that rather change per run can be adjusted via command line args passed to `giV`
```
--help         prints this explanation
--repo         path to the git repository that should be versioned
--cfg          path to the configuration file (explained above)
--branch       the branch that should be versioned, default being master
--outputformat the format of the final output
               [OutputVersion, OutputYAML, OutputJSON]
               OutputVersion being the default
--verbose      print debugging information
```


Output
------

Depending on the `--outputformat` flag, there's several output options.  
The default one just prints the basic version string, while the others provide more information
```
// default
1.2401.0
```
```yaml
# yaml
major: 1
minor: 2401
patch: 0
count: 0
```

```json
// json
{"major":1,"minor":2401,"patch":0,"count":0}
```

Debugging
---------

`giV` with the `--verbose` flag makes it trivial to find issues caused by incorrect configurations.  
The current configuration and both the version changes and resulting version per commit are displayed.
